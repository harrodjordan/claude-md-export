# Claude Markdown Export - Development Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the planned features and improvements for the Claude Markdown Export extension, with a focus on enhancing context management and conversation continuity.

## Current Features (v1.0.0)
- ✅ Export conversations to Markdown format
- ✅ Export with or without thinking sections
- ✅ Floating export panel on Claude.ai
- ✅ Chrome extension popup interface

## Phase 1: Multi-Tier Export System (Q1 2025)

### 1.1 Additional Export Levels
- [ ] **Full Export** - Complete export with thinking, artifacts, and all code blocks
- [ ] **Standard Export** - Current "with thinking" mode
- [ ] **Condensed Export** - Current "no thinking" mode  
- [ ] **Summary Export** - Key points and decisions only
- [ ] **Memory Export** - AI-compressed project state for continuation

### 1.2 Export Level UI
- [ ] Dropdown selector in export panel for choosing export level
- [ ] Preview of approximate output size for each level
- [ ] Tooltip explanations for each export type

## Phase 2: AI-Enhanced Compression (Q1-Q2 2025)

### 2.1 Claude API Integration
- [ ] Settings page for API key configuration
- [ ] Secure storage of API credentials
- [ ] API usage tracking and limits

### 2.2 Smart Summarization
- [ ] Implement conversation summarization using Claude API
- [ ] Extract key decisions and technical choices
- [ ] Generate project state summaries
- [ ] Create structured memory exports with:
  - Project goals and context
  - Technical decisions made
  - Current implementation state
  - Pending tasks and issues
  - Codebase knowledge map

### 2.3 Progressive Summarization Options
- [ ] Configurable compression levels
- [ ] Custom prompts for summarization
- [ ] Preserve user-marked "important" sections

## Phase 3: Adaptive DOM Detection (Q2 2025)

### 3.1 Self-Healing Selectors
- [ ] Implement multiple fallback strategies for DOM selection
- [ ] Pattern-based detection for thinking sections
- [ ] Visual/structural detection algorithms
- [ ] Error reporting and recovery system

### 3.2 AI-Powered DOM Analysis
- [ ] Automatic detection of DOM structure changes
- [ ] AI-based selector generation when manual selectors fail
- [ ] Local caching of successful selector patterns
- [ ] Crowdsourced selector updates (opt-in)

## Phase 4: Token Estimation & Management (Q2-Q3 2025)

### 4.1 Token Counter Implementation
- [ ] Research accurate token counting methods for Claude models
- [ ] Implement client-side token estimation
- [ ] Display token counts for each export level
- [ ] Show remaining context window space

### 4.2 Smart Export Recommendations
- [ ] Detect target platform (Claude.ai vs Claude API)
- [ ] Recommend appropriate export level based on:
  - Conversation length
  - Target context window size
  - Available API tokens
- [ ] Warning system for exports exceeding context limits

## Phase 5: Enhanced Features (Q3-Q4 2025)

### 5.1 Project Knowledge Integration
- [ ] Direct export to Claude Projects format
- [ ] Automatic chunking for large conversations
- [ ] Smart splitting at logical breakpoints
- [ ] Generation of project documentation

### 5.2 Advanced Export Options
- [ ] Export to other formats (JSON, PDF with better implementation)
- [ ] Selective export (date ranges, specific topics)
- [ ] Batch export for multiple conversations
- [ ] Export templates for different use cases

### 5.3 Memory Persistence
- [ ] Local storage of conversation memories
- [ ] Cross-conversation memory linking
- [ ] Memory search and retrieval
- [ ] Memory merge capabilities

## Technical Debt & Maintenance

### Ongoing Tasks
- [ ] Improve error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging system
- [ ] Implement automated testing
- [ ] Performance optimization for large conversations
- [ ] Regular updates for Claude UI changes

### Code Quality
- [ ] TypeScript migration consideration
- [ ] Modular architecture refactoring
- [ ] Documentation improvements
- [ ] Accessibility enhancements

## Future Considerations

### Potential Features (Not Yet Scheduled)
- Integration with other AI platforms
- Collaborative export features
- Cloud sync capabilities
- Mobile app companion
- Real-time conversation backup
- Custom export plugins/extensions

## Contributing
We welcome contributions! Priority areas:
1. Token counting accuracy improvements
2. DOM detection robustness
3. UI/UX enhancements
4. Testing and bug reports

## Notes
- All AI features will require users to provide their own Claude API key
- Privacy-first approach: all processing happens locally where possible
- Backward compatibility will be maintained for basic export features
